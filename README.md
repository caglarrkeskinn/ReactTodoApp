# React Todo Frontend

This project provides a React frontend for managing todos, built to integrate with the [FastAPI Todo Backend](https://github.com/caglarrkeskinn/TodoApp-FastApi).

## Features

- View all todos.
- Add a new todo.
- Update a todo's status.
- Delete a todo.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/caglarrkeskinn/ReactTodoApp
   cd ReactTodoApp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

4. Make sure your FastAPI backend (from [this repository](https://github.com/caglarrkeskinn/TodoApp-FastApi)) is running, as this frontend depends on it.

## Configuration

If you need to point to a different backend endpoint, adjust the API base URL in your React environment config or wherever you've defined it.
